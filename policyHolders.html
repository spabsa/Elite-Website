                <h2>Benefits of working with a licensed Contractor</h2>

                <p>When it comes to hiring any contractor, why should you opt for licensed contractors? Wouldn’t you want to entrust the construction and maintenance of your home 
                to someone regulated by law. Getting licensed isn’t an easy task and comes with requirements. That’s how the Contractors State License Board (CSLB) regulates these 
                businesses ensuring they meet operational and safety standards. For contractors to get licensed under the CSLB they need to have at least four years of experience, 
                and pass exams pertaining to their trade. These contractors also need to pass a criminal background check, and follow safety regulations. Since licensed contractors 
                are regulated they pay insurance as well as pay taxes.<br>Additionally, when you hire a licensed contractor any subcontractors they hire also need to be licensed in 
                their respective trade. This ensures that they have the specialized education and experience to uphold a certain standard of services.<br>
                Aside from all the obvious benefits, a major reason why it’s integral to hire licensed contractors is because your insurance won’t cover costs when you hire unlicensed 
                contractors. Meaning you may lose the benefit of insurance covering repairs, injury, and property damage.<br>
                Licensed contractors are also required to have a bond. This bond license acts as a liability protection. So, in case contractors are injured working on your property, 
                their respective company will cover the worker’s compensation, not you. It also ensures that you are compensated if the contractors fail to deliver what was promised in 
                the agreement.<br>Licensing is a means of protecting you and your interests.</p>
